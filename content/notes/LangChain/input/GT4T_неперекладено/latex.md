# `LatexTextSplitter`

If you want to load documents in Latex format then try out the `LatexTextSplitter`. This class will split your content into documents based on the Latex syntax.
For example, given this Latex input:

```latex
\begin{document}
\title{ü¶úÔ∏èüîó LangChain}
‚ö° Building applications with LLMs through composability ‚ö°

\section{Quick Install}

\begin{verbatim}
Hopefully this code block isn't split
yarn add langchain
\end{verbatim}

As an open source project in a rapidly developing field, we are extremely open to contributions.

\end{document}
```

The `LatexTextSplitter` will split the content into the following documents:

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import Example from "@examples/indexes/latex_text_splitter.ts";

<CodeBlock language="typescript">{Example}</CodeBlock>
